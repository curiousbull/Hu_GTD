* Chaos System with Only One Stable Equilibrium

** Abstract

   A simple three-dimensional autonomous quadratic system that has 
   only one stable equilibrium can be chaotic. The discovery of the
   new system to be reported in this chapter is indeed striking 
   because for a three-dimensional autonomous quadratic system
   with a single stable node-focus equilibrium, one typically
   would anticipate non-chaotic and even asymptotically converging
   behaviors. Although the new system is of non-hyperbolic type,
   therefore the familiar Silnikov homoclinic criterion is not
   applicable, it's demonstrated to be chaotic in the sense of 
   having a positive largest Lyapunov exponet, a fractional dimension,
   a continuous broad frequency spectrum, and a period-doubling route
   to chaos.
